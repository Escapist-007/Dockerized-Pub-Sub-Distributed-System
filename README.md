# Pub-Sub-Distributed-System-Using-Docker
Publish/Subscribe (or pub/sub for short) is a popular indirect communication system. Pub/sub systems disseminates events to multiple recipients (called subscribers) through an intermediary. Examples of successful pub/sub include Twitter and “Bloomberg terminal”-like financial systems. In this project, we will emulate a pub/sub system using the lite weight virtualization or container technology in Docker technology.
